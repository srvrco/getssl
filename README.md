# getssl

Obtain SSL certificates from the letsencrypt.org ACME server. Suitable
for automating the process on remote servers.

## Features

* **Bash** - It runs on virtually all unix machines, including BSD, most
  Linux distributions, macOS.
* **Get certificates for remote servers** - The tokens used to provide
  validation of domain ownership, and the certificates themselves can be
  automatically copied to remote servers (via ssh, sftp or ftp for
  tokens). The script doesn't need to run on the server itself. This can
  be useful if you don't have access to run such scripts on the server
  itself, e.g. if it's a shared server.
* **Runs as a daily cron** - so certificates will be automatically
  renewed when required.
* **Automatic certificate renewals**
* **Checks certificates are correctly loaded** - After installation of a
  new certificate it will test the port specified ( see
  [Server-Types](#server-types) for options ) that the certificate is
  actually being used correctly.
* **Automatically updates** - The script can automatically update itself
  with bug fixes etc if required.
* **Extensively configurable** - With a simple configuration file for
  each certificate it is possible to configure it exactly for your
  needs, whether a simple single domain or multiple domains across
  multiple servers on the same certificate.
* **Supports http and dns challenges** - Full ACME implementation
* **Simple and easy to use**
* **Detailed debug info** - Whilst it shouldn't be needed, detailed
  debug information is available.
* **Reload services** - After a new certificate is obtained then the
  relevant services (e.g. apache/nginx/postfix) can be reloaded.
* **ACME v1 and V2** - Supports both ACME versions 1 and 2

## Installation

Since the script is only one file, you can use the following command for
a quick installation of GetSSL only:

```sh
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvrco/getssl/master/getssl > getssl ; chmod 700 getssl
```

This will copy the getssl Bash script to the current location and change
the permissions to make it executable for you.

For a more comprehensive installation (e.g. install also helper scripts)
use the provided Makefile with each release tarball. Use the `install`
target.

You'll find the latest version in the git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/srvrco/getssl.git
```

For Arch Linux there are packages in the AUR, see
[here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/getssl/) and
[there](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/getssl-git/).

If you use puppet, there is a [GetSSL Puppet
module](https://github.com/dthielking/puppet_getssl) by dthielking

## Overview

GetSSL was written in standard bash ( so it can be run on a server, a
desktop computer, or even a virtualbox) and add the checks, and
certificates to a remote server ( providing you have a ssh with key,
sftp or ftp access to the remote server).

```getssl
getssl ver. 2.02
Obtain SSL certificates from the letsencrypt.org ACME server

Usage: getssl [-h|--help] [-d|--debug] [-c|--create] [-f|--force] [-a|--all] [-q|--quiet] [-Q|--mute] [-u|--upgrade] [-k|--keep #] [-U|--nocheck] [-r|--revoke cert key] [-w working_dir] domain

Options:
  -a, --all          Check all certificates
  -d, --debug        Outputs debug information
  -c, --create       Create default config files
  -f, --force        Force renewal of cert (overrides expiry checks)
  -h, --help         Display this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet        Quiet mode (only outputs on error, success of new cert, or getssl was upgraded)
  -Q, --mute         Like -q, but mutes notification about successful upgrade
  -r, --revoke   "cert" "key" [CA_server] Revoke a certificate (the cert and key are required)
  -u, --upgrade      Upgrade getssl if a more recent version is available
  -k, --keep     "#" Maximum amount of old getssl versions to keep when upgrading
  -U, --nocheck      Do not check if a more recent version is available
  -w working_dir "Working directory"
```

## Getting started

Once you have obtained the script (see Installation above), the next step is to use

```sh
./getssl -c yourdomain.com
```

where yourdomain.com is the primary domain name that you want to create
a certificate for. This will create the following folders and files.

```sh
~/.getssl
~/.getssl/getssl.cfg
~/.getssl/yourdomain.com
~/.getssl/yourdomain.com/getssl.cfg
```

You can then edit `~/.getssl/getssl.cfg` to set the values you want as the
default for the majority of your certificates.

Then edit `~/.getssl/yourdomain.com/getssl.cfg` to have the values you
want for this specific domain (make sure to uncomment and specify
correct `ACL` option, since it is required).

You can then just run:

```sh
getssl yourdomain.com
```

and it should run, providing output like:

```sh
Registering account
Verify each domain
Verifying yourdomain.com
Verified yourdomain.com
Verifying www.yourdomain.com
Verified www.yourdomain.com
Verification completed, obtaining certificate.
Certificate saved in /home/user/.getssl/yourdomain.com/yourdomain.com.crt
The intermediate CA cert is in /home/user/.getssl/yourdomain.com/chain.crt
copying domain certificate to ssh:server5:/home/yourdomain/ssl/domain.crt
copying private key to ssh:server5:/home/yourdomain/ssl/domain.key
copying CA certificate to ssh:server5:/home/yourdomain/ssl/chain.crt
reloading SSL services
```

**This will (by default) use the staging server, so should give you a
certificate that isn't trusted ( Fake Let's Encrypt).**
Change the server in your config file to get a fully valid certificate.

**Note:** Verification is done via port 80 (http), port 443 (https) or
dns. The certificate can be used (and checked with getssl) on alternate
ports.

## Automating updates

I use the following cron

```cron
23  5 * * * /root/scripts/getssl -u -a -q
```

The cron will automatically update getssl and renew any certificates,
only giving output if there are issues / errors.

* The -u flag updates getssl if there is a more recent version available.
* The -a flag automatically renews any certificates that are due for renewal.
* The -q flag is "quiet" so that it only outputs and emails me if there
  was an error / issue.

## Structure

The design aim was to provide flexibility in running the code. The
default working directory is `~/.getssl` (which can be modified via the
command line).

Within the **working directory** is a config file `getssl.cfg` which is a
simple bash file containing variables, an example of which is:

```getssl
# Uncomment and modify any variables you need
# The staging server is best for testing (hence set as default)
CA="https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org"
# This server issues full certificates, however has rate limits
#CA="https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org"

AGREEMENT="https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.0.1-July-27-2015.pdf"

# Set an email address associated with your account - generally set at account level rather than domain.
ACCOUNT_EMAIL="me@example.com"
ACCOUNT_KEY_LENGTH=4096
ACCOUNT_KEY="/home/user/.getssl/account.key"
PRIVATE_KEY_ALG="rsa"

# The time period within which you want to allow renewal of a certificate - this prevents hitting some of the rate limits.
RENEW_ALLOW="30"

# openssl config file.  The default should work in most cases.
SSLCONF="/usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf"
```

then, within the **working directory** there will be a folder for each
certificate (based on its domain name). Within that folder will be a
config file (again called `getssl.cfg`). An example of which is:

```getssl
# Uncomment and modify any variables you need
# see https://github.com/srvrco/getssl/wiki/Config-variables for details
# see https://github.com/srvrco/getssl/wiki/Example-config-files for example configs
#
# The staging server is best for testing
#CA="https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org"
# This server issues full certificates, however has rate limits
#CA="https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org"

#AGREEMENT="https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.1.1-August-1-2016.pdf"

PRIVATE_KEY_ALG="rsa"

# Additional domains - this could be multiple domains / subdomains in a comma separated list
SANS="www.example.org"

# Acme Challenge Location. The first line for the domain, the following ones for each additional domain.
# If these start with ssh: then the next variable is assumed to be the hostname and the rest the location.
# An ssh key will be needed to provide you with access to the remote server.
# Optionally, you can specify a different userid for ssh/scp to use on the remote server before the @ sign.
# If left blank, the username on the local server will be used to authenticate against the remote server.
# If these start with ftp: then the next variables are ftpuserid:ftppassword:servername:ACL_location
# These should be of the form "/path/to/your/website/folder/.well-known/acme-challenge"
# where "/path/to/your/website/folder/" is the path, on your web server, to the web root for your domain.
#ACL=('/var/www/${DOMAIN}/web/.well-known/acme-challenge'
#     'ssh:server5:/var/www/${DOMAIN}/web/.well-known/acme-challenge'
#     'ssh:sshuserid@server5:/var/www/${DOMAIN}/web/.well-known/acme-challenge'
#     'ftp:ftpuserid:ftppassword:${DOMAIN}:/web/.well-known/acme-challenge')


# Location for all your certs, these can either be on the server (so full path name) or using ssh as for the ACL
DOMAIN_CERT_LOCATION="ssh:server5:/etc/ssl/domain.crt"
DOMAIN_KEY_LOCATION="ssh:server5:/etc/ssl/domain.key"
#CA_CERT_LOCATION="/etc/ssl/chain.crt"
#DOMAIN_CHAIN_LOCATION="" this is the domain cert and CA cert
#DOMAIN_PEM_LOCATION="" this is the domain_key. domain cert and CA cert


# The command needed to reload apache / nginx or whatever you use
RELOAD_CMD="service apache2 reload"

# Define the server type. This can be https, ftp, ftpi, imap, imaps, pop3, pop3s, smtp,
# smtps_deprecated, smtps, smtp_submission, xmpp, xmpps, ldaps or a port number which
# will be checked for certificate expiry and also will be checked after
# an update to confirm correct certificate is running (if CHECK_REMOTE) is set to true
#SERVER_TYPE="https"
#CHECK_REMOTE="true"
```

If a location for a file starts with `ssh:` it is assumed the next part
of the file is the hostname, followed by a colon, and then the path.
Files will be securely copied using scp, and it assumes that you have a
key on the server (for passwordless access). You can set the user,
port etc for the server in your `.ssh/config` file.

If an ACL starts with `ftp:` or `sftp:` it as assumed that the line is
in the format "ftp:UserID:Password:servername:/path/to/acme-challenge".
sftp requires sshpass.
Note: FTP can be used for copying tokens only
and can **not** be used for uploading private key or certificates as
it's not a secure method of transfer.

ssh can also be used for the reload command if using on remote servers.

Multiple locations can be defined for a file by separating the locations with a semi-colon.

A typical config file for `example.com` and `www.example.com` on the
same server would be:

```getssl
# uncomment and modify any variables you need
# The staging server is best for testing
CA="https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org"
# This server issues full certificates, however has rate limits
#CA="https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org"

# additional domains - this could be multiple domains / subdomains in a comma separated list
SANS="www.example.com"

#Acme Challenge Location.   The first line for the domain, the following ones for each additional domain
ACL=('/var/www/example.com/web/.well-known/acme-challenge')

USE_SINGLE_ACL="true"

DOMAIN_CERT_LOCATION="/etc/ssl/example.com.crt"
DOMAIN_KEY_LOCATION="/etc/ssl/example.com.key"
CA_CERT_LOCATION="/etc/ssl/example.com.bundle"

RELOAD_CMD="service apache2 reload"

```

## Server-Types

OpenSSL has built-in support for getting the certificate from a number of SSL services
these are available in getssl to check if the certificate is installed correctly

| Server-Type      | Port | Extra        |
|------------------|------|--------------|
| https            | 443  |              |
| ftp              | 21   | FTP Explicit |
| ftpi             | 990  | FTP Implicit |
| imap             | 143  | StartTLS     |
| imaps            | 993  |              |
| pop3             | 110  | StartTLS     |
| pop3s            | 995  |              |
| smtp             | 25   | StartTLS     |
| smtps_deprecated | 465  |              |
| smtps            | 587  | StartTLS     |
| smtp_submission  | 587  | StartTLS     |
| xmpp             | 5222 | StartTLS     |
| xmpps            | 5269 |              |
| ldaps            | 636  |              |
| port number      |      |              |

## Revoke a certificate

In general revoking a certificate is not required.

Usage: `getssl -r path/to/cert path/to/key [CA_server]`

You need to specify both the certificate you want to revoke, and the
account or private domain key which was used to sign / obtain the
original certificate. The `CA_server` is an optional parameter and
defaults to Let's Encrypt ("<https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org>") as
that is currently the only Certificate Authority using the ACME
protocol.

## Elliptic curve keys

You can use Elliptic curve keys for both the account key and the domain
key (different of course, don't use the same key for both). prime256v1
(NIST P-256) and secp384r1 (NIST P-384) are both fully supported.
secp521r1 (NIST P-521) is included in the code, but not currently
supported by Let's Encrypt).
